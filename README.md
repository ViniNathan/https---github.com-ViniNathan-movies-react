This is an React app created based on a TheMovieDB API tutorial available on youtube with top notch frontend technologies such as React, Redux & SCSS. In this project I've used core concepts of ReactJS such as jsx, components, props, state, lifecycle of components, conditional rendering, lists, keys & Redux.
